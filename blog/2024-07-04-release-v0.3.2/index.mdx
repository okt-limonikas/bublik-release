We are happy to announce **Bublik v0.3.2**.

<!--truncate-->

In the latest release, we've implemented several updates and improvements. We've reordered buttons and links on run page. A new feature has been added to display aggregated values min/max in the logs. Bug fixes include modifying the log display to show only entries with aggr of "single" on the chart, making datasets for charts and tables optional in reports, and removing the "%" sign for values that are "-" or "na" in reports.
