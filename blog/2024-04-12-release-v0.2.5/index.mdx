We are happy to announce **Bublik v0.2.5**.

<!--truncate-->

This update brings numerous enhancements to both the frontend and backend of Bublik. On the frontend, fixes were made to address issues like page overflow in the log section and adapting search parameters to API changes in history. Bugs such as app crashes due to toast messages on email confirmation page and various issues in the history section were resolved. Also we changed default logs to experimental ones by default. You can toggle those off in user settings if you have issues with experimental or use button above "Legacy" to disable experimental logs. Backend improvements include fixing issues with detailed run statistics and completing various chores to streamline operations. These changes aim to improve overall performance and functionality.
