This project consists of two main components:

1. **React Application (UI)**  
   The core user interface of the project, built with React. It includes all the necessary tools and instructions for setting up, building, and running the frontend application. You can also run the UI locally or in a Dockerized environment for development or production purposes.

2. **Documentation Website**  
   A dedicated static website for project documentation. Built with modern tools, it provides guides and resources for both developers and end-users. The documentation site supports live preview during development and can be easily built for deployment.
